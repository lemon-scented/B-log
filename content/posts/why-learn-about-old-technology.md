# Why learn the old stuff ?

For one, you can see how certain technologies have progressed over time and
whether they were able to stay relevant by adapting or if they where made
obsolete by something else (does not necessarily mean something better).
Another advantage to learning the history of computers and computer science is
that you get a way better understanding of WHY things are the
way they are (most of the time is is for backwards compatibility).
This holds true for pretty much all the major pieces of hardware and software
you interact with on a daily basis as a programmer. I would encourage everyone
to think about all the technology they use everyday and base their opinions on
it's merit instead of it's age or popularity.
