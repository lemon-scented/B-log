I wanted to make some points on why I think it can be worth it to look at older technology compared to what is more current.

* You get to learn from the mistakes/success of the greats.
* You can see the limitations of technology from a certain time period compared to now and how it would be different today?
* As software and hardware gets more mature, more people and more projects come to depend on it.
* The new becomes the old and vice versa. Many ideas are perpetually rehashed and adapted to fit current needs.

I would encourage everyone to think about all the technology they use everyday and base their opinions on it's merit instead of it's age or popularity.
