## What have I done?

So I thought I would give a little update on what's new with my setup - specifically my mobile setup.

Well, here's the news - I bought a new M1 MacBook Air (2020) about 2 or 3 weeks ago.
It is the lowest spec version too - so 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD and all the hype.

This is also my first Apple computer - my first Mac - so that's pretty neat.
The ARM processor is also a big reason I wanted to get one of these things.

I haven't had too much time to really customize it that much, but I have installed
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), switched the default shell to the newest version of
bash and installed some desktop programs I use a bunch like Discord, Spotify, Notion, VS Code etc,.

## What do I like?

Here is a list of the things that I knew I would like about the M1 MacBook so they
were not that surprising:

- Sharper font rendering (1440x900 resolution helps)
- Battery life (roughly 10hrs)
- Trackpad haptic feel and precision is awesome - like no other laptop out there
- Touch ID
- Fast wake time
- Aluminum Construction

## What I don't like

- The price: this laptop costs $1000 buckaroos and the specs are lacking to say the least.
- Learning new keyboard shortcuts (default CMD/Option key behavior is strange)
- Window management still lacking (no keyboard shortcuts for windows snapping by default)
- Supporting Apple - a trillion dollar corporation that is the epitome of proprietary software/hardware

## Moving forward

I will be posting updates here about my experience using macOS for development and daily tasks.
Let's see what happens!
