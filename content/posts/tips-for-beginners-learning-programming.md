These are some thoughts about my personal experience with learning a new programming
environment like shell scripting (but this applies to almost any new environment).
This is mainly based off mistakes and shortcomings I've made in the past, so this
post will be pretty cathartic, but maybe it will help someone.

### 5 Tips

1. **Don't** try to memorize _every_ command, _every_ API, _every_ function, etc.
   Learn enough to become functional in the environment. Build something and move on.
2. Think about tools in terms of what you're trying to accomplish and use those tools
   to accomplish something (no matter how small).
3. Have a structured process for getting help and use it frequently.
4. Realize that commands/interfaces have different design goals and that's OK!
5. Know when a command/library/framework doesn't cut it and when to make your own.

Let me elaborate on these points a little bit.

#### Point 1 (Memorization bad!?!)

Memorizing commands/APIs/functions/methods for their **own sake** is very much
grabbing the wrong end of the stick when it comes to programming and it can
actually hinder you in the long run.

Yes, it may be helpful for learning things like syntax, language conventions and system utilities,
but beyond a certain point, enumerating over a list of commands or keywords
without practical application is pretty ineffective and doesn't lead to good retention.

Basically memorization should not be _the focus_ when learning, but rather
something that happens semi-autonomously.

#### Point 2 (Quality > Quantity)

This may sound obvious, but what I'm actually trying to say is take some time
to **actually use** the language and commands you're learning -- preferably on projects that
you care about. It may seem helpful and time efficient to try and learn a bunch at once
(thinking of those articles with titles like "top 100 Linux commands every developer/sysadmin should know")
but in my experience, this approach is a complete waste of time.

#### Point 3 (Get help when you need it and know when to step away from a tutorial)

Of course, knowing how to read documentation is important as well: skim the man page,
look at the docs, read an article or two online if you're stuck,
but don't fool yourself -- that's not going to help you out with _muscle memory_
or any kind of memory for that matter.

I think Shia has the right idea here. There's no easy way to learn something.
The best approach is to...

**Use the thing**, let it sink in, and don't worry if you don't know a certain syntax
or special command that you've practically _never used_ because you _don't have a use-case_ yet.
Finding a use-case for a technology is often a problem in and of itself, so don't
feel bad if you don't see the point of something like Docker or Kubernetes.

#### Point 4 and 5 (Complex software is overwhelming, everyone copes differently, know your limits)

On that note, there's lots of money and influence involved in selling/marketing
complex solutions to other Developers and IT staff in "the enterprise". If you
are a beginner, understand that most of this stuff isn't supposed to be your domain
-- and that's A GOOD THING.

It's a big industry where lots of companies are competing for "mind share" among
newer developers. There are "XYZ language evangelists" and "XYZ cloud advocates" who give talks
about how you can get "XYZ cloud certificate". It's fine to learn from these,
but I'm afraid the line between education and advertising gets blurry fast when
it comes to this kind of stuff.

Real life example: One of my classes uses AWS Cloud9 so every student
can host a Ruby on Rails app. Is it a decent service? Sure. Does it also give
students a reason to use AWS over other cloud providers in the future? Yes.
(I'm not complaining - I'll take my industry experience, but I found that interesting)

Don't feel pressured to add complexity to something simple just because everyone
else is - especially when you're starting out. I'm specifically thinking of
all the frameworks and libraries used in modern web development (front and backend).
There's cases to be made both ways here.

Give yourself ample time to understand core language features before diving into
libraries and frameworks.

Lastly here's some motivational:

- **Learning takes time; pace yourself and don't cram until the point of burnout**
- **Real life practice > all the tutorials in the world**
- **Do research, but don't get discouraged if other people have tried solving the same problem**
- **Don't compare your work to others (unless you're truly finished with a project)**
- **It's OK to not know stuff!**
- **Take a break from time to time**
