#### Rant about cloud, influence and education

It's a big industry where lots of companies are competing for "mind share" among
newer developers. There are "XYZ language evangelists" and "XYZ cloud advocates" who give talks
about how you can get "XYZ cloud certificate". It's fine to learn from these,
but I'm afraid the line between education and advertising gets blurry fast when
it comes to this kind of stuff.

Real life example: One of my classes uses AWS Cloud9 (an online IDE) so every student
can host a Ruby on Rails app on Heroku. Another one had us sign into Azure and
set up an Azure Active Directory instance to practice security. These are
regular classes with a dash of cloud sprinkled in, but it still represents
a positive feedback loop whereby these cloud providers and customers
of cloud providers directly benefit from education referring students to their services.

I'll take my faux industry experience but I wanted to put my thoughts out there as
I think this practice sets a bad precedent across the board, but I'm probably
the minority on this. It seems like most people these days either don't care or
accept the fact and move on.
