I am in no way qualified to talk about game desgin, but I thought I'd share
some of my thoughts on what makes platforming games so great and iconic as
an average gamer.

## Platforming games will always be relevant

Throughout the decades, several styles of games have come in and out of fashion.
Action RPGs, MMOs, FPS, Arena Shooters, MOBAS, Battle Royale.

Platforming is a more fundamental game design principle, and often game studios
choose add extra layers to it in order to make it more interesting.

What I'm going to do is try to break down what makes platforming games good,
what are some of the things I enjoy in platforming games, and give some examples.

## Movement

## Environments and Levels

## Art Style

## Enemies

## Sounds
