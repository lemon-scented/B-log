1. **Don't** try to memorize _every_ command or _every_ switch.
2. Think about tools in terms of what you're trying to accomplish.
3. Have a structured "lookup order" for getting help.
4. Realize not all commands are built equally (poor design, inefficient, side effects)
5. Know when to look for a command/library and when to make your own.

## Scripting Tips

These are just some of my thoughts about my experience with learning programming
and shell scripting (and other general scripting languages).
Here are some tips I would give to my past self.

In my opinion, memorizing commands for their **own sake** is very much grabbing the
wrong end of the stick. Yes, it may help out at first with learning shell conventions
and system utilities, but beyond that, enumerating over a list of commands with
minimal practical usage becomes a very ineffective way to "learn" new commands.

This may sound obvious, but what what I'm really trying to say is take some time
to **actually use** the commands you're learning -- preferably on projects that
you care about.

Of course, reading the documentation is an important skill as well: skim the man page, look at the help,
read on article online, but don't fool yourself -- that's not going to help you at all with _muscle memory_.

**Use it**, let it sink in, and don't worry if you don't know/remember a command that
you've practically _never used_ because you _don't have a use-case_.
Finding a use-case for a technology is often a problem in and of itself.

Here's the things I want you to remember:

- **Learning takes time**
- **It's OK to not know stuff!**

#### Scripting In Tutorial Hell

Many books and online articles will give a list of commands and a brief
description of what they do with all the subcommands, switches and tons of examples.
Same for libraries and frameworks.  What more could you ask for, right?

In my experience, reading these resources (documentation) is great if you have
a specific goal in mind, otherwise they don't really "stick" and it will be hard to
find motivation to learn in the long-term.

You're also likely to forget anything if you don't test and apply your knowledge, and
this rings exceptionally true for technical stuff.
Make sure you physically follow along on your own machine or lab if you have
the chance, or even better -- spin off and do your own thing.

#### Thinking abstractly

The process of associating "keyword" to a "type of problem" is a foundational to any
kind of programming, so it's pretty funny to hear the reasons people think scripting is
not "real programming". It's the same concept and you're using many of the same
constructs -- just at different levels of abstraction.
People may disagree with the design decisions of a language,
but that's an entirely different argument.

The problem is that building up this "association" doesn't always comes fast or easy.
Typically the more time you spend on it, the stronger the association becomes
and it will become easier to match "problems" to "keywords".

So my message is this: don't think too narrowly or concretely about learning
new commands and tools. You never know when something will come in handy, but
ask yourself some preliminary questions first like

- "What kind of problem can I solve with this? It is a common or rare use case?"
- "Does this thing add value to my life (productivity/enjoyment)?"
- "Is it necessary? Can it be done with existing tools? How much effort would it take?"
