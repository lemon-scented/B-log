These are just some of my thoughts about my experience with learning
a new programming environment like shell scripting (and other general scripting languages).
Here's what I would say to my past self.

### My 5 Tips

1. **Don't** try to memorize _every_ command.
2. Think about tools in terms of what you're trying to accomplish.
3. Have a semi-structured process for getting help.
4. Realize that all commands/interfaces are not built equally
   (poor design, inefficient, side effects).
5. Know when a command/library/framework doesn't cut it and when to make your own.

### Let me elaborate

In my opinion, memorizing commands for their **own sake** is very much grabbing the
wrong end of the stick. Yes, it may help out at first with learning shell conventions
and system utilities, but beyond that, enumerating over a list of commands with
minimal practical usage becomes a very ineffective way to "learn" new commands
in the long run.

This may sound obvious, but what what I'm really trying to say is take some time
to **actually use** the commands you're learning -- preferably on projects that
you care about.

Of course, reading the documentation is important as well: skim the man page,
look at the help, read an article or two online if you're stuck,
but don't fool yourself -- that's not going to help you at all with _muscle memory_
or any kind of memory for that matter.

**Use it**, let it sink in, and don't worry if you don't know/remember a command that
you've practically _never used_ because you _don't have a use-case_ yet.
Finding a use-case for a technology is often a problem in and of itself, so don't
feel bad if you don't see the point of something like Docker or Kubernetes.

On that note, there's lots of money and influence involved in selling/marketing
complex solutions to Developers and IT staff in "the enterprise" (go figure).
Don't feel pressured to add complexity to something just because everyone
else is - especially when you're just doing your own thing. Sometimes the trade-off
is not worth it, but seeing both sides is something that comes with more exposure and
experience. I still have a hard time gauging whether some new library or tool
is "worth the hassle".

Here's what I would say to my past self:

- **Learning takes time; pace yourself and don't cram until the point of burnout**
- **Real life usage > all the textbooks and tutorials in the world**
- **Do research, but don't get discouraged if other people have tried solving the same problem**
- **Don't compare your work to others (unless you're truly finished with a project)**
- **It's OK to not know stuff!**
- **Know when to step away and take a break**
