So we are about mid-way through April which means that it's about time for a
new blog post. Last month I scheduled my Comptia Network+ exam for April 30th
and I have been going over that material for some time now. Although it is an
entry level exam it does cover a **wide** range of topics just not in that much
depth. I'm in the process of making my own "study guide" and may provide a 
link to that as it may be of help anyone in the future. 

I have been sick these last couple of days too, i'm thinking it's mostly due to 
seasonal allergies that come up every year. This time it is particularly bad, 
but in a different way than I'm used to. I've been trying to drink lots of water
and get much rest but it is hard when I have so many things I want to do and so 
much internet to surf.

Here's to a quick recovery.
