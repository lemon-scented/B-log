So we are about mid-way through April which means that it's about time for a
new blog post. Last month I scheduled my Comptia Network+ exam for April 30th
and I have been going over that material for some time now.

As an entry level exam it does cover a **wide** range of topics, at the cost of
not in that much going into depth.

I'm making my own "study guide" and may provide a
link to that as it may be of help anyone in the future.

I have been sick these last couple of days too, I'm thinking it's due to
seasonal allergies that come up every year.

But I'm used to it. I've been trying to drink lots of water and get rest.

Here's to a quick recovery.
