### Escaping from Tutorial Hell

Many books and online articles will give a list of commands and a brief
description of what they do with all the subcommands, switches and tons of examples.
Same for libraries and frameworks. What more could you ask for, right?

In my experience, reading these resources (documentation) is great if you have
a specific goal in mind, otherwise it doesn't really "stick" the same as when
using something for a purpose. Unless you're doing light research, I would not
recommend going too deep into documentation.

You're likely to forget anything if you don't test and apply your knowledge, and
this rings exceptionally true for technical stuff.
Make sure you physically follow along on your own machine or lab if you have
the chance, or even better -- spin off and do your own thing.

#### Thinking abstractly

The process of associating "keyword" to a "problem" is foundational to any
kind of programming, so it's pretty funny to hear the reasons people think scripting is
not "real programming". It's the same concept and you're using many of the same
constructs -- just at different levels of abstraction.
People may disagree with the design decisions of a language,
but that's an entirely different argument.

The problem is that building up this "association" doesn't always comes fast or easy.
Typically the more time you spend on it, the stronger the association becomes
and it will become easier to match "problems" to "keywords".

So my message is this: don't think too narrowly or concretely about learning
new commands and tools. You never know when something will come in handy, but
ask yourself some preliminary questions first like

- "What kind of problem can I solve with this? It is a common or rare use case?"
- "Does this thing add value to my life (productivity/enjoyment)?"
- "Is it necessary? Can it be done with existing tools? How much effort would it take?"
