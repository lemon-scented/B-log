## Much excite for GSoC 2019

The title pretty much says it. The excitement is building and I cannot wait to
start contributing code and ideas to the community. This will be my first time
participating in anything like this, so I'm not 100% sure what to expect but I
imagine it will be a very fun and interesting experience. I will try to keep
updates on here on a monthly basis --at least--, but in the meantime, it's work and study

Cheers everyone!~
