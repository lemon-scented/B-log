I am a college student and general technologist who enjoys exploring new (and old)
experiences with technology, gaming, computers and whatever else pops into my
consciousness.

## Areas of Interest

"General technologist" goes to say I have a pretty broad interest
in computers and I'm not particularly specialized in any one area.
Here's a list of the things I like to mess around with in no particular order:

- Linux and Free Software
- Networking / Web APIs / Web Servers
- Virtualization / Containerization
- Databases
- Security and Hardening
- Self-hosting / Raspberry Pis
- Game Development
- Cryptocurrency and DeFi

I'm not ashamed to say that there are tons of people who have far more knowledge
and experience with everything I listed. I also understand that each of these topics
are incredibly complex in their own right -- even before people build systems
and frameworks around them.

That's probably the main reason I wanted to start a blog.
I wanted to share some of my thoughts and findings because maybe someone out there
would find it useful.
If nothing else, it will be my way of documenting my journey through tech.

## Languages

I think programming languages and syntax matter less than most people realize
but that doesn't stop it from being a real barrier to entry and yet another
source for internet tribalism _cough_ sorry ecosystems to grow around.

I'll still list the ones I use(d) so people can judge me for not being a
"real programmer":

### Intermediate Level

These are the languages I tend to reach for first in order to solve problems.

- Python :snake:
- PowerShell/Bash :shell:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript :yellow_heart:

### Beginner Level

These are languages that I use less often, where I would consider myself a beginner.

- C/C++ :dragon:
- Go :cloud: :whale:

### Classroom Experience Level

These are languages I have used primarily for classroom projects and learning
purposes.

- Ruby :red_circle:
- PHP :elephant:
- C# / .NET :knife:
- Java :coffee:

### Tech I would like to learn and use in the future (for fun and profit)

- Rust
- Godot Game Engine
- Ansible (or other configuration management/automation)

### Misc. Certifications

- CompTIA Network+

## Other hobbies

Other things I enjoy learning about include:
history, art, psychology, physics, geometry and philosophy,
not necessarily in that order.

### PC Gaming

I do enjoy assembling high-end (or even budget) PCs and playing games as well.
