I am Computer Science student who enjoys getting into and learning **all** kinds of technology.

Right now I am mostly experimenting so I have no real projects worthy of GitHub at the moment, but
you can expect that to change very soon.

If you would like to contact me, please feel free. My email is notjamesdixon@gmail.com.
