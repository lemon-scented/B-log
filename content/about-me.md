I am a Computer Science student who enjoys getting into and learning **all** kinds of technology.
Other areas of study I gravitate towards are history, physics, geometry and philosophy. :bust_in_silhouette:

I do enjoy playing PC games every now and then, but I don't have much time as of late, and have lost the friends I used
to play online with. (this is so sad) :'( -- My [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatonepyro) and [PSN](https://psnprofiles.com/Old_Salty_Lemon)

Another thing I love doing is building PC's. I put my first computer together when I was 12 and have basically been doing it for friends and myself ever since.
PRO TIP: Head over to [/r/buildapcsales](http://reddit.com/r/buildapcsales) to find some nice deals on parts.

On the side I also enjoy tinkering with cars and driving/seeing cool rare cars, but unfortunately that has taken a backseat as the
cost of college tuition and books looms overhead I made the executive financial decision to sell my project cars.
Hopefully I can get myself something nice to drive after getting a good job :)

Right now I am mostly experimenting and exploring so I have no real projects worthy of GitHub at the moment, but
you can expect that to change in the near future.
