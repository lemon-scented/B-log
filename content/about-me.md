## $ whoami
I am a computer science student who enjoys exploring and learning new concepts
and interesting technologies.
I also enjoy learning about the history of the
field. Doing so has helped me to put the pieces together
and to satiate some of my curiosity about the inner workings 
of modern computers. There are so many rabbit holes and twisty turns to get
caught up in, but that's what makes it great.
The breadth and depth of knowledge out there seems almost infinite;
it is certainly more than any one person can fit in their head, yet there
is always the opportunity to carve out your own section and improve it.
Anyways thanks for listening to my TED talk :laughing: 

## Areas of interest
A couple of areas that I gravitate towards are Linux/Unix,
FOSS, Networking, Web APIs, Virtualization, Automation and 
occasionally messing with Raspberry Pi's.
One day I hope to give something of value back to the community
by making something really cool and helping others from my experience :metal:.
Other things I enjoy learning are history, physics, geometry and philosophy.

I do enjoy playing PC games every now and then,
but I don't have much time as of late, and have lost contact with the friends 
I used to play online with. (this is so sad) :sob: --
My [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatonepyro)
and [PSN](https://psnprofiles.com/Old_Salty_Lemon)

Another thing I love doing is building PC's.
I put my first computer together when I was 12 and have basically been doing it
for friends and myself ever since.
**PS:** If you happen to be looking for deals on PC parts

On the side I also enjoy tinkering with cars and driving/seeing cool rare cars,
but unfortunately that has taken a backseat as the
cost of college tuition and books looms overhead :school_satchel:
I made the executive financial decision to sell my project cars.
Hopefully I can get myself something nice to drive after getting a good job :)
