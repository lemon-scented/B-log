## Hello, World ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy exploring the technology (both new and old) that powers our lives.
That will be a focus on this blog - many posts will be about my experiences
with technology, gaming, computers and whatever else pops into my attention.

## Education

I graduated with a B.T. in Computer Science in 2021 from [CSU](https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/)
located around Charleston, SC.

## Areas of Interest

Here's a list of the things I like to mess around with in no particular order:

- Web APIs
- Web Servers
- Virtualization
- Containerization
- Computer Networking
- Linux and Free Software Projects
- Relational Databases
- Security and Hardening
- Reverse Engineering
- Self-hosting / Raspberry Pis
- Game Development
- Cryptocurrency and DeFi

I wanted to share some of my thoughts and findings working with these technologies
and doing projects as a way of documenting my journey through tech.

## Languages

Much like natural language, programming languages are simply tools of the mind.
If you think about text, letters, symbols - the alphabet. These concepts are used
to represent abstract ideas in natural languages and programming languages are no different
(albeit much more _precise_ or _verbose_).

Here are the programming languages that I like to use:

### Intermediate Level

These are the languages I tend to reach for first in order to solve problems.

- Python :snake:
- PowerShell/Bash :shell:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript :yellow_heart:

### Beginner Level

These are languages that I use less often, where I would consider myself a beginner.
I have used these languages in smaller projects outside of class.

- C/C++ :dragon:
- Go :cloud: :whale:
- Java :coffee:
- C# / .NET :knife:
- SQL (sqlite, MySQL)

### Classroom Experience Level

These are languages I have used primarily for classroom projects and learning
purposes.

- Ruby :red_circle:
- PHP :elephant:

### Tech I would like to learn and use in the future (for fun and profit)

- Rust
- Godot Game Engine
- Ansible (or other configuration management/automation)

## Other hobbies

Other things I enjoy learning about include:
history, art, psychology, physics, geometry and philosophy,
not necessarily in that order.

### PC Gaming

I do enjoy assembling high-end (or even budget) PCs and playing games as well.
You can find me on the following platforms

- [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatonepyro)
- [PSN](https://psnprofiles.com/Old_Salty_Lemon)
