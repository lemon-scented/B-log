## Short Introduction

I am a computer science student who enjoys exploring and learning new concepts
and interesting technologies. I also enjoy learning about the history of the
craft. Doing so has helped me to put the pieces together and to satiate some
of my curiosity about the inner workings of modern computers. There are so many
rabbit holes and twisty turns to get caught up in, but that's what makes it
great. The breadth and depth of knowledge out there seems almost infinite;
it is certainly more than any one person can fit in their head, yet there
is always the opportunity to carve out your own section and improve it.

## Areas of interest

### Software

I have many interests in software, but am in no way an expert in any one in
particular.
Some of the broad topics that I find myself gravitating towards include:

- Well Documented FOSS Projects

- Linux / Unix :penguin:

- Networking / Web APIs / Web Servers

- Virtualization / Containerization :whale2:

- Automating things that don't need to be automated

- Game Development :video_game:

- Homelabs / Homeservers / Raspberry Pis

- Distributed protocols like tor, bittorrent and ipfs

- Many other technologies that exist in the present and the future that I am
not yet aware of :milky_way:

### Languages

- Python :snake:

- Bash :shell:

- Go

- JavaScript

- C / C++


## Other hobbies

Other things I enjoy learning about include:
history, psychology, physics, geometry and philosophy,
not necessarily in that order.

### PC Gaming

I do enjoy playing PC games as well. You can find me on the following platforms

- [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatonepyro)

- [PSN](https://psnprofiles.com/Old_Salty_Lemon)

Another thing I love doing is building PC's.
I put my first computer together when I was 12 and have basically been doing it
for friends and myself ever since.

### Cars

On the side I also enjoy tinkering with cars and driving/seeing cool rare cars.
Some of my favorites are old Toyotas, BMWs and VWs. 
Unfortunately, I have sold my project cars for now, but
hopefully I can get myself a nice fixer-upper sometime in the future. :blue_car:
