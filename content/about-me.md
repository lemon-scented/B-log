## About Me

Hello, World ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy exploring technology new and old - so that will be a focus on this blog -
many posts will be about my experiences with technology, gaming, computers and
whatever else pops into my attention.

## Education

I graduated with a B.T. in Computer Science in 2021 from CSU.

## Areas of Interest

Here's a list of the things I like to mess around with in no particular order:

- Linux and Free Software Projects
- Networking / Web APIs / Web Servers
- Virtualization / Containerization
- Databases
- Security and Hardening
- Self-hosting / Raspberry Pis
- Game Development
- Cryptocurrency and DeFi

I wanted to share some of my thoughts and findings working with these technologies
and doing projects as a way of documenting my journey through tech.

## Languages

I think programming languages and syntax matter less than most people realize
but that doesn't stop it from being a real barrier to entry and yet another
source for internet tribalism _cough_ sorry ecosystems to grow around.

I'll still list the ones I use(d) so people can judge me for not being a
"real programmer":

### Intermediate Level

These are the languages I tend to reach for first in order to solve problems.

- Python :snake:
- PowerShell/Bash :shell:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript :yellow_heart:

### Beginner Level

These are languages that I use less often, where I would consider myself a beginner.

- C/C++ :dragon:
- Go :cloud: :whale:

### Classroom Experience Level

These are languages I have used primarily for classroom projects and learning
purposes.

- Ruby :red_circle:
- PHP :elephant:
- C# / .NET :knife:
- Java :coffee:

### Tech I would like to learn and use in the future (for fun and profit)

- Rust
- Godot Game Engine
- Ansible (or other configuration management/automation)

### Misc. Certifications

- CompTIA Network+

## Other hobbies

Other things I enjoy learning about include:
history, art, psychology, physics, geometry and philosophy,
not necessarily in that order.

### PC Gaming

I do enjoy assembling high-end (or even budget) PCs and playing games as well.
